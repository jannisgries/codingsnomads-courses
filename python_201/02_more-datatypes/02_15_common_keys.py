# Write a script that takes the following two dictionaries
# and creates a new dictionary by combining the common keys
# and adding the values of duplicate keys together.
# Use `for` loops to iterate over these dictionaries
# to accomplish this task.
#
# Example output:
# result = {"a": 3, "b": 2, "c": 7 , "d": 2}

dict_1 = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
dict_2 = {"a": 2, "c": 4 , "d": 2}

for key, value in dict_2.items():
    if key in dict_1:
        dict_1[key] += value
    else:
        dict_1.update({key: value})

print(dict_1)
